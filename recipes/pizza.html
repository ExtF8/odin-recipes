    <h2 class="heading descr">Description</h2>
        <p>These days, it's easy to pick up the phone and order a pizza that gets delivered to your door. You can even get really good pizza delivered to your door.</p>
        <p>But I'm still a sucker for the homemade version. On chilly winter nights, I love a sheet pan pizza piled high with toppings, like this meat lovers' version.</p>
    <h2 class="heading ingr">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>8 ounces Italian sausage</li>
            <li>2 pounds room temperature pizza dough, homemade or store-bought</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce, homemade or store-bought</li>
            <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>4 ounces ham</li>
            <li>4 ounces pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced thin</li>
            <li>Dried parsley, garnish</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="heading steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="ol">
            <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°F</li>

            <br>
    
            <li>Prep the sausage</li>
                <p>The only thing you need to cook for the toppings is the sausage. Cook it in a medium skillet over medium heat until it's cooked through, about eight minutes. Break up the sausage as it cooks.</p>
    
            <li>Shape the pizza crust</li>
                <p>Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle roughly the size of your quarter-sheet pan. Then lift and transfer it to the pan, and press it into the sides of the pan firmly to form a lip of dough.</p>
                <p>Don't be nervous about this step! Pizza dough is sturdy. Even if it tears a bit, just press it together in the pan and it'll bake up fine!</p>
                <p>Try to make sure the dough is an even thickness on the bottom of the sheet pan, but it doesn't have to be perfect. Having some inconsistencies makes homemade pizza great.</p>
    
            <li>Top the pizza</li>
                <p>Once the dough in the sheet pan, add the sauce in a thin layer. You can add more sauce if you like a saucier pizza, but I personally like a thin layer.</p>
                <p>Then add the cheese followed by all the toppings. Finish the pizza with big sprinkles of dried parsley and season with salt and pepper.</p>
    
            <li>Bake the pizza for 20 to 25 minutes</li>
                <p>It's done when the crust around the edges is puffed and a deep tan color. The center should be bubbling hot and some of the cheese may have even browned a bit in spots.</p>
    
            <li>Cool and serve</li>
                <p>Let the pizza cool slightly before cutting and serving. Slice into square-ish shaped pieces. Leftovers will keep for about a week. It's best to reheat them in a covered skillet over low heat for a few minutes.</p>
